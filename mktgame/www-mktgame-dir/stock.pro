                     *** PROSPECTUS FOR THE STOCK ***

Each share of stock pays a dividend after every San Francisco 49ers
regular-season football game.  The dividend equals the number of
points the 49ers score.  The first dividend will thus be paid at the
end of the Saints game on September 1, and the last after the Lions
game on December 23.
