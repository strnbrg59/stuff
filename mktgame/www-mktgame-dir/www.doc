				Security Concerns We Must Deal With

1. The password file, even though it's not readable by the "world", does
lie in the cgi-bin directory.  Therefore anyone (on rahul, anyway) can
simply copy the password file to himself, and look at it there.

2. Virtual html forms must identify the user not just by name but by
password as well.  Otherwise anyone can execute an order for anyone
else by just invoking CGIbldordr and sending it the user's name in
stdin.  Eventually, you should encrypt the password using some
technique that produces a different encrypted version every time, so
that if someone intercepts the transmission, he can't retransmit and
execute on behalf of someone else.

I am beginning to remedy this problem.  I've started with disp_choices1()
(called by CGInamepwd), making it send the password as a hidden variable.
Now I'm working on the program that is the ACTION invoked by the virtual
html file produced by disp_choices1().
