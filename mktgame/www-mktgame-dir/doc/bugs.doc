1. Not really a bug, but a potential gotcha.  You can't change a player's
name by just editing players.dat and then renaming all his .act files.
This is because the first order he'll try to place, a function called
increment_numorders() will look up his name in the last HOLDING record
in his .act file, and then try to dump out to an .act file owned by that
person.  But the name will be the old name.  The program will abort.

2. Another gotcha.  Poisson reads security.par.  So if you change the
force-markets in security par without restarting poisson, you'll have
forced sales going through in inappropriate markets.
