The goal now is to make aqc run on the WWW.

1. 	A problem that was minor in the past becomes significant now.  This
is the matter of players checking the order book, placing a market order,
then finding that the limit order they wanted has been taken.  
	The solution: cause limit orders to cross with each other, if the 
highest limit bid is >= the lowest limit ask.  This way, the worst thing
that can happen, when you try to snap up a very low ask, is that your
(limit) bid just stays on the book.

2. Security is much improved, now that aqc doesn't have to run suid.
