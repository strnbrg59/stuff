To make this work at Persistence.

1. Use jdk1.1.5 (not /usr/java).
2. Run rmiregistry on port 19594 (it's hard-coded into the server and all the clients).
3. JAVA=/usr/local/tools/jdk1.1.5
4. PATH="$JAVA/bin:$PATH"
5. CLASSPATH=".:$HOME/src/java:$JAVA/lib:$JAVA/lib/classes.zip"
6. Type make in this directory.
7. Go to jqc/server and type "java jqc.server.Server&".
8. Go to jqc/client or jqc/client/GUI and start any of the clients.

Try sourcing /home/teds/bin/jqc-env.ksh; it takes care of all the environment
issues above.

I've gotten it to work on Hades, Hermes, Athena and even Saturn.
