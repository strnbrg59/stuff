# These are characteristics of the traded assets.
# Fields that do not apply should say "null".
# The underlying-asset field is three things encoded -- a '+' or '-' to
#	indicate whether the option is an option to buy or an option to sell,
#	the strike price, and the underlying asset's name.  The underlying
#	asset's name must begin with a letter.
