                   EQUILIBRIUM ANALYSIS OF THE MARKET GAME
1. Equilibrium interest rates
Consider round 3, where the game goes on for two weeks, there's no cash
flow until t=2 (i.e. end of game), and there's a market for bonds.  We are
interested in predicting the equilibrium interest rate.

1.1. Two things drive the interest rate--the firm's marginal productivity
of capital, and the convenience yield on cash.

If we make the money supply smaller than the firm would need to finance a
full five Dow days, then the interest rate, at t=1-epsilon, will surely
be positive, since the firm will wish to gather up most or all of the money
supply to finance its investment.

Between t=0 and t=1-epsilon, cash is valuable only for its convenience yield,
but the interest rate will (on the expectations theory) reflect the
expectation that at t=1-epsilon the interest rate will be very much nonzero.

After t=1, i.e. after the firm has raised its cash, the interest rate will
reflect only the convenience yield of holding cash, and that convenience will
be valued only by people who plan to do a fair amount of trading (and so wish
to avoid losing money from repeated market orders in the bond market).  But
the interest rate shouldn't drop much from what it was at t=1-epsilon; if
it did, there would be a huge profit opportunity: buy bonds at t=1-epsilon,
and sell them at t=1+epsilon!

The return on cash is really its convenience yield.  (Just as in the
real world; if cash had no convenience yield, there would either be
none of it, or the interest rate would be zero.)

2. The optimal supply of money
Let d = number of dow days bought,
    x = sum of absolute % changes over the d days,
    c = cost of each dow day,
    n = number of players,
    y = revenue to firm,
    i = interest rate,
    A, B, E = constants,
    p = firm's profit (earnings).
We have
    y = A + Bd + Ex,
    c = cd,
so
    p = y - c(1+i),
and marginal profit = B + Ex'(d) - c(1+i).

This is a good way to construct the revenue and profit functions.  A large
constant A (relative to E) ensures the risk will be small or modest relative
to the expected return.  Too much risk (as in y = Ex - c(1+i)) makes most
interest rates irrelevant, and renders players fatalistic and powerless.

The right money supply is, roughly, one that, when fully employed by the
firm, is enough to finance three Dow days.  Marginal profit will be zero
in equilibrium, giving us an interest rate that satisfies
                        B + Ex'(d) - c(1+i) = 0
or
                          1+i = [B + Ex'(d)]/c

Assuming x'(3) = 0.3, if we set
   B=c=4  and E=1,
we have
   1+i = [4+.3]/4 = 1.075,
a very nice interest rate!  And the per-capita money supply that supports
that interest rate is
   Mn = 3c => M = 3c/n = 12/20 = .6 for E203, and
                       = 12/80 = .15 for BA132.
Denominate B,c and E in thousands, and you get $600 and $150 respectively
for M, nice amounts.

Will there be problems in the 3+ week game, when I have to do open-market
operations to stanch the money supply?  I'm going to have to sell bonds
worth the amount of the corporate profit, which will be
           A  + Bd  +  Ex(3) - c(1+i)
         = 10 + 4*3 +  1.2   - 4(1.075)
         = 23.2              - 4.3
         = 18.9.
Well, that's only about 1.5 times the desired money supply, so people won't
be overwhelmed by their riches.  Of course, this amount will be added to their
wealth each week (when we play for 4+ weeks), and each week I'll have to not
just soak up the latest profit, but also refinance all the old bonds I issued
to soak up earlier profits.
