This directory contains handouts I have used to introduce various game
scenarios to my students.  (It's all in TeX format.)

basic.tex: This is the most elementary version of the game--a stock
and a default-free bond.  It contains detailed instructions on how to
access the game, interpret the game's various displays, and find
one's way through the menus.  (These instructions are not to be found
in the other files.)

ipo.tex: Initial public offerings.  Each section of the course "owns"
a separate firm.  Students meet to decide on investment and its
financing (hence the IPO).  

convbond.tex: Stock, convertible corporate bonds, call options, risk-free
bonds.

endogint.tex: Endogenous interest rate.  Fed steps aside and sets the
bond market free.  There are three bonds here, useful for illustrating
term structure and arbitrage concepts.

forex.tex: Dollars, pounds, dollar bond, pound bond, and endogenous
interest rates.
