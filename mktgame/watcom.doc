    CHANGES THAT HAD TO BE MADE TO COMPILE, LINK AND RUN AQC UNDER WATCOM

1. In aqc.h
  #ifdef __WATCOMC__ #define __TURBOC__.  This is so we don't include UNIX-
    specific *.h files, or invoke curses functions, under Watcom C.

2. Warning about out-of-range constants.  Strange.  In disptrad.c, forcesal.c,
  and portf.c, we call fseek() with something like (-2)*sizeof(CASH) in the
  second argument.  Watcom complains about this, even though it doesn't
  complain about 2*sizeof(CASH).  I let it compile anyway.

3. In the makefiles
  Argument list to wcl386 too long.  I put all the .obj files in to aqc.lib.
  Batch file wlibw.bat creates this library automatically.
  But now the linker finds all sorts of undefined references.

  So, instead, let's just write wcl386 ... *.obj.

  OK, that worked.  Now make sure you have only one .obj file with a main()
  in it, lying around at any one time.  But if you forget, and there are two
  .obj's with main() in them, the linker lets you know.

4. discwind.c
  Had to put coreleft() inside #ifndef __32BITBYTES__ .

5. poisson.c
  Had to put randomize() inside #ifndef __32BITBYTES__ .

6. fwddeliv.prj/mak: compiles and links, but I haven't tested it under Watcom.
