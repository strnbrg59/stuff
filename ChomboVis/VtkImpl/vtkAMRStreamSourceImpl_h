// .NAME vtkAMRStreamSource
// .SECTION Description
// vtkAMRStreamSource is a vector feild  trace generation class that takes
//   an AMR data structure represented by a ChomboReader object, and
//   a set of points that are originating points.
//
//  IntegrationMode refers to the manner of discretely advancing a
//  fiedline along a seed point.  0 fixed steps
//                                1 fixed steps clipped for vector
//                                  magnitude change
//
//                                2 Richardson extrapolation (3 point)
