We wrote ChomboVis so that users could view the 2D and 3D data sets
generated by tools in the <a target="_parent"
href="http://seesar.lbl.gov/anag/chombo/" target="_parent">Chombo</a>
library.  Visualizing Chombo output was a challenge because none of
the available visualization tools directly supported hierarchical
collections of grids.

<P> ChomboVis is built on top of the <A target="_parent"
HREF="http://www.kitware.com">Visualization Toolkit (VTK)</A> and <A
target="_parent" HREF="http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5">HDF5,</A> and
consists of source code in C++ and Python.  Chombo produces HDF5
files.  ChomboVis reads those files and uses VTK for visualization.
ChomboVis provides a variety of methods for visualizing the data sets
including color mapping, grid display, slicing, isosurfaces/contours
and streamlines.  ChomboVis users can browse the data directly as
numbers, selecting grids by several possible means.  And while the
familiar face of ChomboVis is its interactive graphical user
interface, Python programmers can now automate ChomboVis through a
documented application programming interface (API).


<P>In this guide we intend to be honest about the good points, the bad
points, and the limitations of ChomboVis.  We have overcome some but
not all of the difficulties connected to the visualization of
hierarchical collections of grids.  ChomboVis accesses and visualizes
individual grids separately, and the resulting geometry is collected
and rendered in one image.  This means that the data set isn't
visualized in a completely integrated manner.  This method has been
workable but we still look forward to writing VTK extensions that
would directly handle collections of grids.  Another limitation, for
now, is that only levels and individual grids can be selected and
examined but other collections of grids cannot be selected.
