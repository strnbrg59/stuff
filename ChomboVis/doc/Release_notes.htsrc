boundary, yet.  See checkbutton on embedded boundary dialog, or
EbApi.setBlankCoveredCells().

<H1> New in release 4.0.2 </H1>

<H1> New in release 4.0.1 </H1>
Fixed install bug.

<H1> New in release 4.0.0 </H1>
<UL>

<LI> The analysis framework is complete.  A while back (see below
under "The 3.9x.y release series") we planned to bump the major
version number to 4 upon completion of the analysis framework.  It's
been pretty much complete for some time.  It will surely continue to
evolve slowly.  In any case, it's time for 4.0.0 if only because we're
running out of numbers under 3.9x.y.  So in fact the difference
between this release and the last one is not huge; it consists of one
new feature...

<LI> Embedded boundary support in the databrowser.
</UL>

manipulation, etc.  See VisualizableDataset and BoxLayoutData class
documentation, in API.html.

<H1> New in release 3.90.0 </H1>

Release 3.90.0 introduces the first Analysis Framework feature, <A
HREF="reader_api.html">on-the-fly creation of new data components.</A>

<H1> The 3.9x.y release series </H1>
ChomboVis 3.9x.y is the alpha releases leading up to 4.0.0.  The major

HDF5 dataset during a ChomboVis session.  To see what's coming up, see
