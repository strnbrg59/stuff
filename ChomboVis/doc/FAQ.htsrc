<H1> Do I need Chombo too? </H1>

ChomboVis builds and runs without need of Chombo.  While it is true
that the format for ChomboVis' input data happens to be the output
format of Chombo, we provide a program, ascii2hdf5, that can get you a
ChomboVis-legal input file.  When you build ChomboVis, you will find
the executable script ascii2hdf5.sh in the ChomboVis home directory.
See under ascii2hdf5 <A HREF="Other_features.html">here.</A>

<H1> How can I make ChomboVis run faster? </H1>

<OL>

<LI> Put <TT>slices_off=1</TT> on your command line.

<LI> Use the right mouse button to slew the sliders.

<LI> Avoid the higher refinement levels (pull down <A
HREF="Visualization.html">Visualization menu,</A> choose "Data
selection").

<LI> Look at lower-dimensional slices (see slice_axis and
axis_position <A HREF="Command_line.html">command-line options).</A>

<LI> Use <A HREF="Command_line.html">chombodata or chombobrowser</A>
instead of chombovis.

<LI> Set autorender off (pull down the Options menu).

</OL>

<H1> Installation problems </H1>

<H2> <TT>undefined symbol: grBufferSwap</TT> </H2>

This means you can not use Mesa.  See
ChomboVis_x_y_z-and-everything/Readme for instructions on how to build
against OpenGL, instead of Mesa.

<H2> ImportError: No module named vtkpython </H2>

When you built VTK, you should have obtained something called
vtkpython.so.  

<P> When you installed VTK, two things should have happened.  One,
vtkpython.so should have been copied to
/usr/local/lib/vtk/python/vtkpython.so (or if you said --prefix when
you invoked VTK's configure command, make the appropriate substitution
for /usr/local).  Two, you should have wound up with a file
vtkpython.pth, probably under /usr/local/lib/python2.1/site-packages.

<P> If you don't have a vtkpython.so anywhere, then something went
wrong when you built VTK.  If you do have a vtkpython.so but you don't
have the vtkpython.pth, then create a file of that name and type one
line into it: the path to the directory where your vtkpython.so is
(for example, /usr/local/lib/vtk/python).

<P> Try building from ChomboVis_x_y_z-and-everything.tar.

<H2> Segmentation fault </H2>

Try putting "user_render_widget=0" after "chombovis", on your command
line.  Whether that helps or not, please let <a
href="mailto:chombovis@davis.lbl.gov">us</a> know you encountered this
problem.

<H2> Should ChomboVis build on SGI Irix and Solaris? </H2>

<P> Some of our users have done successful SGI and Solaris builds.
Their detailed instructions can be found in the <A
HREF="Installation.html">Installation</A> section.
