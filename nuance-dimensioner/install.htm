Dimensioner, Nuance's provisioning tool, helps partners and customers
estimate the system requirements for a given application.  Dimensioner
is a Java based tool, so you will need to have Java 2 Runtime
Environment installed in your system.  The instructions below include
links for downloading Java, if you do not already have it installed.

<H2> Windows </H2>

<H3> 1. Install Java 2 </H3>

<P>
To check if you already have Java 2 installed, open an MSDOS command
window and type "java -version". If your system responds with "java
version 1.2" or "java version 1.3", you can proceed to step 2.  (Java
version numbering is confusing. Java 2 corresponds to versions 1.2 or
1.3.)

<P>
If you do not have Java 2 installed, you can download it for free from
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/jre/download-windows.html"> Sun.
</A>  Select the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), which is the
smallest of the various packages available.  

<P>
After installing the JRE, type "java -version" in the MSDOS command
window again.

<P>
<H3> 2. Download <A HREF="dimensioner.zip">dimensioner.zip</A>.</H3>

<P>
<H3> 3. Unzip dimensioner.zip. </H3>

<P>
The zip file contains four files:

<UL>
<LI> Dimensioner.jar
<LI> dimensioner.bat 
<LI> install-help.html (this file)
<LI> manual.html (user's manual)
</UL>

<P>
<H3> 4. In Windows Explorer, go to the directory where you unzipped dimensioner.zip. </H3>

<P>
<H3> 5. Double-click on dimensioner.bat. This will start Nuance Dimensioner. </H3>

<P>
<H3> 6. You can drag dimensioner.bat to your desktop, for quicker access in the future. </H3>


<H2> Unix </H2>

<H3> 1. Install Java </H3>

<P>
You need a Java virtual machine.  If you don't have it, it's available
(for free) from <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se"> Sun. </A> Get the
Java Runtime Environment (JRE) if you want to run Java software but don't
need to develop too; the JRE is the smallest of the various packages.

<P>
The above link points to the Java 2 product.  If you have Java 1.1 on
your machine, you can still run Dimensioner, but you will have to
obtain the Swing library (bundled with JRE 1.1.x).

<P>
After installing, try typing "java -version" at the command line.  It
should come back with something like "java version 1.2".

<P>
<H3> 2. Download <A HREF="dimensioner.zip">dimensioner.zip</A>.</H3>

<P>
<H3> 3. Unzip dimensioner.zip. </H3>

<P>
<H3> 4. To start Nuance Dimensioner, type "java -cp Dimensioner.jar Dimensioner".</H3>
