1.  Grouped TextField-Label and TextField-Button pairs into
    objects of type PanelWithTextFieldAndLabel (and its subclasses).

2.  Replaced hard-coded component sizing with flexible sizing based on
    various LayoutManagers.  This will improve portability to systems
    with different font sizes.

3.  In the CloneGrammarDialog, added a "Close" button, because "Cancel"
    might make user worried was was about to lose his new grammar.  
    Replaced "OK" button with "Save" (but retained all the functionality).

4. Split TopLevel into a class BackEnd and a class FrontEnd.  BackEnd
   doesn't manipulate any variables external to it, but does read traffic
   parameters by calling the getters in class TrafficParameters.
   BackEnd exposes just six methods -- solveFor<X> where X is BHCV,
   BlockProb, etc.  It should be easy now to replace BackEnd with an
   alternative implementation, say one based on simulation.

5. Added number-of-CPUs textfield.  Total required and minimum required
   results take account of the num_cpus not just in the queueing model (where
   Flood's N is set to num_cpus) but also in ensuring that total_RU_required is
   at least equal to num_cpus * minRUperCPU.

6. Fixed bug in endpointer-on-server calculation; there was a misplaced
   parenthesis.

7. Went from using GET method, to using POST method.  GET is limited
   by the server limit on $QUERY_METHOD, and we can easily exceed that
   with even a moderately long grammar model.
