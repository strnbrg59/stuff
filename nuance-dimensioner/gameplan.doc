1. Get it to work with awt alone.
   DONE, but the bordered panels are gone.  (The Swing version has them.)

2. Separate the algorithms out into their own class, BackEnd.
   DONE

6. Instead of having BackEnd's solveFor methods call getters on a global 
   TrafficParams and GrammarDatabase, have FrontEnd pass BackEnd a copy of
   these, as necessary (and have FrontEnd hold such objects as private data).
   DONE for TrafficParams, but GrammarDatabase is still "global".

8. Persistent store for grammars defined in the clone-grammar dialog. 
   Not done yet.

   Persistent store for the grammar combinations defined in the List. 
   DONE

   Ability to delete grammars from the Choice. 
   DONE

9. Get those borders to show up right, in the awt version.  See my code
   in javax/swing/JPanel.java.

10. Finish transition from String interfaces to Grammar interfaces: 
    In computeAh() and FrontEnd.cloneButton_MousePressed(), you are searching
    through the GrammarDatabase.  You should be able to just call a method
    of GrammarDatabase, rather than write such search code every time.
    DONE.

11. Implement test cases for solveForRecognitionPower, now that it's easier
    to manipulate GrammarList's. 
    DONE

12. In design.html, document the fact that string representations of Grammar
    objects are now just implementation details, and that whenever methods
    need to pass around information about grammars, they pass Grammar objects,
    never their string representations. 
    DONE

13. Delete grammars from the GrammarList by clicking on a "delete" button,
    rather than double-clicking.  Double-clicking should instead display
    a full description of the grammar -- together with all the options used
    to compile it and then measure its LU rating.  
    DONE

14. Remove all "import java.awt.*;" lines.  You shouldn't be mixing awt with
    swing at all.

15. Display the list of grammars (in GrammarChoice widget) as a hierarchical
    tree -- language, type, number-of-names.

16. Load the grammars from a file.  The applet version can get them off a web
    page.  Ideally, that would be the official provisioning web page (with
    the links to details pages, but that would mean imposing some rigorous
    structure on those web pages).

17. Let applet version save data, somehow.
