<P>
Cardation is a flashcard app for Android that's optimized for
learning languages.  I wrote it because among the many fine Android
flashcard apps out there (see
<A HREF="http://www.droidforums.net/forum/android-applications/5536-review-flashcard-apps-droid.html">http://www.droidforums.net</A>
for a good review of what's out there) I could not find one that handled
the direction -- English-to-foreign vs foreign-to-English -- the way I liked.

<P>
Get Cardation <A HREF="CardationCLI-signed.apk">here.</A>

<P> Cardation is simple and crude -- kind of like this web page!  I
might add features and snazzy looks in time, but since at this point
it does what I need, I'm now mostly a user, rather than a developer,
of my own app.

<P> Before I get into screen shots and usage details, I'll explain the
main "pedagogical" algorithm, including that dual-direction-handling
that made me get started.  The algorithm is based on the idea of a
"streak" (in which I was inspired by Leo Wandersleb's very nice <A
HREF="http://fluxcards.de">FluxCards</A> app).  Every word has its streak,
and the streak goes up by one every time you get that word right.  The
next time Cardation quizzes you on that word will be in about 2^streak
days (where "^" means "power-of").  So the better you know a word, the
less often you'll see it, allowing you to concentrate on the words you
don't know so well.  That's the basic idea, and up to this point
Cardation uses streaks much like FluxCards (and probably a lot of
other such apps).

<P> The difference is the direction, i.e. English-to-foreign vs
foreign-to-English.  And here's Cardation's rule: it starts you out in
the foreign-to-English direction (because it's easier), but after your
streak hits a certain point, the direction switches to
English-to-foreign.  (I should say, "native-to-foreign", since there's
nothing about Cardation that requires you to use English; by "English"
I mean simply the language you use to provide yourself with a
definition for the foreign word.)  But get the wrong answer a few
times and the direction will switch back to foreign-to-English.

<P> I'll save the finer streak-related details for a little later.
Now let's go to the screenshots and instructions.  Or just <A
HREF="Cardation.apk">download</A> the thing and start using it;
there's not much that's unobvious.

<P> Here's the "home" screen: <P> <image
src="images/cardation_menu.jpg" ALIGN="left" HSPACE=20> <P> Gets
right down to business, doesn't it?  You can "learn" (which means, get
quizzed) or "input".
For, as indicated above those options, your Yiddish words.  What?  Yiddish
happens to be one of <EM>my</EM> languages, so it shows up in my
screen shot.  The brand-new Cardation you'll download actually has no
languages at all -- only an option for "New language",

<P>
<image src="images/cardation_languages.jpg" ALIGN="right" HSPACE=20>
<P>

which, when tapped (not shown here) prompts you to enter the name of a
language you do care about.

<P>
To get to this list of all your languages, tap the current language.
Notice that one of my languages is "English".  That's for cool new
words I encounter now and then, and wish to learn.  The number
indicated as "due" tells you how many cards Cardation will quiz you on
right now, if you press the "Learn" button.

<P>
More options are accessible from the three-dots-thingy
at upper right: <P> <image src="images/cardation_dropdown_menu.jpg">
<P>
I'll get to them later.

<H3> Learn </H3>

<P> At this point, you'll need some words, but I want to cover the
menu options in the order they appear, so let's assume you somehow
acquired some words, and you're ready to be quizzed on them.  (Or skip
ahead to the section on "Input".)  Hence
the <EM>Learn</EM> option.  A word (in this example the foreign one)
is shown.  If you think you know what it means, tap the green
<EM>yes</EM> button.  If you don't know, tap the red <EM>no</EM>
button.  If you know, but you had to think a while, tap the amber
<EM>meh</EM> button.  Tapping any one of these buttons reveals the
answer (and the quote, if there is one).  At that point, tap the
<EM>yes,</EM> <EM>no</EM> or <EM>meh</EM> button again.  Only this
second tap really counts, and it "counts" in the sense that it affects
your streak.  The streak is actually a pair of numbers (in this case
(-3,-3)), of which the first is your "forward streak", the second your
"backwards streak".  If you're currently in "forward" mode, i.e. the
clue word is the foreign word, then tapping <EM>yes</EM> increases the
forward streak (leaving the backwards streak unaffected).

<P>
<image src="images/cardation_learn.jpg" ALIGN="left" HSPACE=20>
<P>

<P> Notice (I'm sure you've already noticed) that the streak is a negative
number.  If you apply the 2^streak formula from above, the implication is
that this word will come up again in one-eighth of a day.  But actually
that's not what happens.  The 2^streak rule applies only to nonnegative
streaks.  A negative streak means the word will come up again...now.  Well,
not <EM>right</EM> now, but right after the other words in your current
"batch" (which I will define).

<P> That (-3,-3) streak happens to be the streak assigned to a
brand-new word.  And so after the first press of the green <EM>yes</EM>
button, the streak goes to (-2,-3).  If you press green the next time
the word comes up, the streak goes to (-1,-3).  The next step is of
course to (0,-3), but that's a special point because when your forward
streak reaches zero, Cardation switches direction on you.  It starts
quizzing you in the reverse, i.e. English-to-foreign, direction.  At
that point, if you keep pressing the green button, you whittle down your
streak to (0,-2), then (0,-1) and (0,0).  Once you're at (0,0), you're
finally in the 2^streak regime: that word falls out of your current batch
and it won't show up again for one (i.e. 2^0) day.

<P> That covers the green <EM>yes</EM> button.  If you don't know the
word and, accordingly, press the red <EM>no</EM> button, your streak
goes down.  But it doesn't work quite symmetrically.  It works as in
the "Snakes and Ladders" game: if your streak is positive -- it could
be 5, 6 or even 107 -- pressing the red button drops your streak all
the way to -1.  That ensures you'll see the word again during your current
session.  When it comes up again, if you press the green button, the
streak goes to zero and the word will next show up in a day's time.  But
if you still don't remember and press the red button again, your streak
drops to -2, and next time to -3.  If after that you <EM>still</EM> can't
get it, the streak will not drop further.  But something else happens: if
you're in backwards mode (English-to-foreign) and you drop to -3, then
Cardation sets both streaks to -3 and switches the direction to forward; at
this point you've proven that you really need to relearn this word starting
with the easier direction.

<P> Having gone through the effects of the green and red buttons,
explaining the amber <EM>meh</EM> button is easy.  It halves your
streak, positive, and leaves it unchanged, if negative.  In other
words, it's an intermediate measure, between "no" and "yes".  That's
it.  You may choose not to ever use the amber button; you don't have
to.  It's just there to give you a little more control, if you want
it.

<P> Below "streak" there is something about "batch".  The batch is
your current set of cards, the cards Cardation will present to you
over and over.  Some of these are cards with negative streaks -- new
words, or older words you've forgotten.  Others could be words you
know well -- words with positive streaks -- which just happen to have
come up because it's time.  For example, a word with a streak of 3 is
a word that you pressed <EM>yes</EM> on eight days ago.

<P> The number "now due" (here shown as 3), is related to the batch.  As you
work through the words in your batch, they will drop out of the batch, one by
one, as you press <EM>yes</EM> and get their streaks to zero or more.  When
a word drops out of the batch like that, another word enters the batch to take
its place, and that word comes from those "now due".  After a while, all your
due words will be in your batch, and at that point when a word leaves your
batch, there's nothing to replace it, and so your batch will diminish.  When
it reaches zero, you're done.  Until next time.

<P> To the right of the information about batch size, you see "Cram".
Cram mode sort of lets you change Cardation's clock.  Set cram to 1
and your "now due" cards will be those that would have come up one day
from now.  Set cram to, say, 4, and your "now due" cards will be those
(possibly a large number) that, under normal circumstances would have
come up in 2^4=16 days.  I recommend leaving cram at 0, and going
outside to play when no more words are due.

<P> And one more thing about streaks and the power-of-two rule: Cardation
throws in a little randomness, to spread the word "due dates" out
a little.  So don't expect to see a word in <EM>exactly</EM> 2^streak days.

<H3> Input </H3>

<P> Now for the <EM>Input</EM> option.

<image src="images/cardation_input.jpg" ALIGN="left" HSPACE=20>

It's simple: type your foreign word on the first line and your
definition (in English or whatever) on the second line.  The third
line is the "quote" line: it's for an illustrative quote, an
etymological note, or really anything you like.  Or nothing at all.

<P> The checkbox labeled <EM>active</EM> indicates if you want
Cardation to quiz you in the English-to-foreign direction (after you
master the easier foreign-to-English direction of course, as discussed
above).  <EM>Active</EM> is checked by default as I've assumed you'd
like most of your words to become part of your <EM>active</EM> (hence
the name) vocabulary.

<P> The <EM>Input</EM> screen is how I happen to acquire most of my
words; typically I'm reading something, I see a word I don't know, I
look it up in a dictionary, and I enter it into Cardation.  There's
a faster alternative, a way to import an arbitrary number of words
wholesale.  But I'll cover that when I get to the <EM>Restore</EM> option
because first I have to talk about the format your imported words will
need to be in, and that has to do with the <EM>Backup</EM> option, which
also comes later.

<H3> Search </H3>

<P> The very next option is <EM>Search,</EM> which is pretty much what it
sounds like.  Type in the search box, or scroll through the list.

<P>
<image src="images/cardation_list.jpg" ALIGN="right" HSPACE=20>
<P>

If you tap on one of these words, you come to a page
<P>
<image src="images/cardation_edit.jpg" ALIGN="right" HSPACE=20>
<P>
where you can edit that word as well as its definition, the quote if
any, the
<EM>active</EM> checkbox, and the word's streaks.  You can also delete
a word.  To do that, just backspace over the first (i.e. foreign)
line, and press "Save".

<H3> Configure </H3>

Yeah, Cardation isn't very configurable at this point, sorry.

<image src="images/cardation_config.jpg" ALIGN="left" HSPACE=20>

<UL>
    <LI> Batch size is, well, batch size.  Bigger batches are harder.  I like 10.
    <LI> Initial Streak is what's assigned to a new word.  Set it to, say, -5,
and you'll get more practice on that word, before Cardation decides to remove
it from your batch (and plan on showing it to you again in about one day's time).
    <LI> RandReversal is the probability that, even though your forward streak
    is nonnegative and you've checked the "active" box, you'll get quizzed in
    the forward direction.  The default of 10 (%) seems reasonable to me.  It
    seems wise to "randomly reverse" now and then, but not so often.
</UL>

<H3>Statistics</H3>

The graph shows how many words will be due at all future dates.  The
horizontal axis (whose label does not, for some reason, show up in the
Android emulator I grabbed these screenshots from) is logarithmic.

<P>
Some day, perhaps, I will add other information on this page, and then its
plural name will finally be justified.
<P>

<H3> Backup </H3>

<P> Backup is, of course, for backing up your cards.  I know there are
fancy cloud backup solutions in the Android API, but I picked
something easier and (as you'll see) more flexible: email.  Backup
just emails you (as an attachment) a file that has all your words (and
their definitions, quotes, streaks and due dates -- everything).  In
fact, to save time, "backup" backs up everything you have and sends
you as many attachments as you have languages.

<P>
If you try to open such an attachment in your Android device's email,
Cardation offer itself up to "open" that attachment.  If you accept
that offer, Cardation will import those words.  And that is the
wholesale word-importation feature I mentioned earlier.  Obviously,
it's a way to restore from your own backups, but it's also a way to
import new cards.  You just have to get the file format right, but
it's pretty simple -- fields delimited by '@'.  Oh yeah, don't try
using Cardation to memorize email addresses.

<P>
Words from the attachment are copied to your Cardation collection only if
you don't already have the clue-word (i.e. the "foreign" word).

<H3> Restore </H3>

<P> Restore is not the recommended way to restore (say, from a
backup).  To make it work, you need a way to copy a file (in the
format described above, under "Backup") to the /mnt/sdcard directory
of your Android device.  So don't; it's not worth the bother, since
you can do it over email.

<H3> Delete </H3>

"Delete" removes a language from your device.  Fortunately, it does a
backup first.

<P>
<H3> Infrequently-asked questions </H3>

<P>
Q0. How do you pronounce _Cardation_?<BR>
A0. "Car-day-shee-un".  Just remember the second 'a' is long.<BR><BR>

Q4. Is there a version for the iPhone/Pod/Pad family of products?  Is there
an online Javascript-powered version?<BR>
A4. No, nope. <BR><BR>

Q5. Why don't you upload Cardation to the Google Android app store?<BR>
A5. Sloth.<BR><BR>

Q6. Can we see your source code?<BR>
A6. It's at <A HREF="https://github.com/strnbrg59">GitHub.</A>
<BR><BR>

Q7. What are some exciting new features planned for the future?<BR>
A7. Here's some of my to-do list.<BR>
<UL>
    <LI> Respond to pinch gesture </LI>
    <LI> Long press goes to Wiktionary </LI>
    <LI> More statistics </LI>
    <LI> Miscellaneous user interface improvements </LI>
    <LI> Tie-ins with social media, travel agencies, reality shows, etc. </LI>
</UL>

<BR>
Q8. What's my expected daily "load", that is, if I tend to add <I>w</I> new
words each day, then in steady state how many words will be "due" every day?<BR>

A8. Growing but manageable.  Let's assume, for now, that you never
forget.  Then your load today is the <I>w</I> new words you added
today; plus the <I>w</I> new words from yesterday (you got them
right yesterday, putting their streak at 0 and their due date therefore one
day (<I>2^streak</I>) into the future); the <I>w</I> words you added three
days ago (they came up 3 days ago, then 2 days ago at which point their streak
went to 1 and their due date was pushed 2 (<I>= 2^streak</I>) days ahead);
the <I>w</I> words you added 7 days ago; the <I>w</I> words you added
15 days ago; etc.  So if you started using Cardation <I>n</I> days ago,
your load today is <I>w*log_2(n+1)</I>.  Say you're a power user and you
plan to add a word a day forever.  Then your daily load will be nine words
after one year, eleven after five years, and twelve after ten years.

<BR><BR>

If you're an eager beaver and plan to add ten new words a day, your
load will indeed be ten times higher, and of course 108 (in five years
of that) is quite a lot.  But it seems unlikely anyone will reach that
point; we're talking about knowing <I>5*365*10=18,250</I> words!
Long before reaching that point, you're an expert at whatever language
and unlikely to encounter anything like ten unfamiliar words a day.

<BR><BR>

All of that assumes you never forget.  When you forget a word
(i.e. you press the red "No" button), its streak goes to -1.  That
increases your load.  There's a formula for that too but it's too
complicated to be very enlightening.  And so instead, here is a table
with some representative values.  None of them look at all onerous to me.

<BR><BR>

<BR><BR>
Q9. How can I merge two decks?<BR>

A9. Good question!  This comes when people use Cardation to study for
school tests in memory-intensive subjects such as anatomy.  Then let's
say you have a "language" called Anatomy_master and another called
Anatomy_new which you created because you wanted to study for a test
and not be bothered with material from old tests but now with the test
behind you, you want to warehouse your new body parts with your old
body parts, for the final exam, hence Anatomy_master.  To merge
Anatomy_new into Anatomy_master, make a backup and import the
Anatomy_new email attachment into the Anatomy_master "language".  And
then delete Anatomy_new.
