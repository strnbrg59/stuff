# If I say "make -f super_makefile cmc", it prints "cmc".  But if I
# uncomment the ".PHONY" part, then I get "make: Nothing to be done for
# `cmc'."  Adding "-d" to that command shows something utterly amazing:
# gmake is looking for rules to make super_makefile.c, super_makefile.f,
# super_makefile.y, and on and on.
# 
# If I rename super_makefile to "Makefile", the problem goes away.

.PHONY : cmc mmc
%mc :
	@echo $*mc
