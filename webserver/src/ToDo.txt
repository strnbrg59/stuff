1. webserver -h prints the list of config parameters.  Unfortunately, it also prints
a message from config about what the program is about.  And since there's only one
config.cpp, and we wrote the mailserver first, the message says this is a mailserver.

2. Relative URLs don't work from files called index.html.  They do work from any other
html file.  For an example, look at ~strnbrg/ngrams/ngrams.html and index.html.

3. <ALLOW> and <DENY> tags.  Look at test-strtok-xml.cpp for the one
function, out of the Nuance XML effort, that we really need.  Indeed
we couldn't use the full Nuance XML parser because it imposed some
stringent restrictions on the HTML file -- no metadata, no angle
brackets within comments (might still be a problem for us), no tag
attributes.
DONE.
