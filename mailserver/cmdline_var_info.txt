# If you edit this file while the mailserver is running, the mailserver
# will reread this file and reset its params accordingly.  Beware, though,
# that if you started mailserver with params set on the command-line, those
# will be overridden by any changes you make to this file.  (Perhaps a little
# counter-intuitive; at start-up, the command line overrides this config file,
# but later this config file overrides whatever was on the command line.)
#
# Note that the smtp_port param can't be changed at runtime.
