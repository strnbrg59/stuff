This project is an +-3g accelerometer, an LCD panel, and an Atmega168.
It's meant for use in a car.

Unlike ../accelerometer here we don't use an audio speaker, and we're
not concerned with clever hairtrigger mechanisms for starting the
accelerometer (we're assuming that in a car electrical power is
plentiful), and we're not concerned with storing data in the eeprom.
Also, ../accelerometer uses an Attiny.
