== On almanzo (Compaq/HP Presario with all USB ports).

Plugged in USB-to-serial cables and kernel immediately created
/dev/ttyUSB0 and /dev/ttyUSB1.

Connected these through a null modem cable.  Started "serialport -r"
in one xterm and "serialport -w" in another.  The first string I sent
was read and acknowledged.  But after that, the reading side just
waited on the read(2).  If I unplug the read-side's USB-to-serial
cable and plug it back in (restarting ./serialport), then I can read
another string.

Minicom, instead of "serialport -r", does keep acknowledging (and
correctly printing) whatever I send from the "serialport -w" side.
