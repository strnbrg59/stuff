1. Take some of the #defines (like ANNCTIME) and make them static
members of class Car.  Initialize them from a response file, using
the load_var() function from rpnprog/misc_util.hpp.
DONE

2. Take the code in the big ctrlvars() function and break it up into
member functions for class Car.
DONE

3. Rename class Car to class Vehicle, and derive Car and Truck from
it.  Give trucks weaker acceleration and deceleration.  
DONE (kept Car as abstract base class, created derived classes Porsche and Bus).

4. Make the function that displays a pixel a virtual member of class
Vehicle.  Give class Truck a bigger pixel.
DONE
