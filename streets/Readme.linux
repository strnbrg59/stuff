*** Porting to Linux and (especially) C++ ***
1. 	Defined struct Coordinates.
2.	Replaced about half of the Turbo C graphics calls with vga.h calls.
3.  Smart subscripts: defined class Car_array.

*** Miscellaneous notes ***
1. Disabling graphics
		
	Work through Makefile: define GRAPHICS to graphicsoff, and
	type "make streets_graphicsoff".  But first remove all .o files,
	because some of them (left over from "make streets_graphicson")
	expect to link to the vga.h functions.
