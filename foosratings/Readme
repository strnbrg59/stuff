1. Install the Gnu Scientific Library, libgsl.

2. Run bootstrap and configure.

3. The executable you want is install/bin/foosrater.  Try it like this:
$ ./install/bin/foosrater games_file=./foosratings/src/realgames.txt

The executable has command-line options; look at
foosratings/src/pingpong.sh for how to set options appropriate to
Ping-Pong.

4. Miscellaneous
    a. We only use a little bit of the stuff in utils.  Utils is just a grab-bag
       of utilities I've written for my own entertainment, over the years.  The
       code quality reflects various phases of my skill with C++.  Best just not
       to look there.

    b. If you're looking for the core rating algorithm, look at the MLE()
       function in foosratings/src/regression.cpp.

    c. Running the foosrater program leaves behind cruft that I don't try to
       clean up.  Sorry.

5. Explanation of the algorithm: foosratings/web/theory.html.
