<H2> Player ratings: what they mean </H2> 

Ratings indicate which of two teams is the favorite (i.e. more likely to
win, based on data from past games).  Suppose players rated <EM>a</EM> and
<EM>b</EM> go up against players rated <EM>c</EM> and <EM>d</EM>.  If
<EM>a+b</EM> is greater than <EM>c+d</EM>, then the first two players are
the favorites.

<P> The ratings also predict margins of victory.  The expected margin
of victory for players <EM>a</EM> and <EM>b</EM> is approximately 8
times <EM>a+b-c-d</EM>.  But this is only a crude approximation; the
following table gives more exact values:

<PRE>

    1.3      7.27     
    1.4      7.53     
    1.5      7.77     
    1.6      7.98     
    1.7      8.17     
    1.8      8.35     
    1.9      8.50     
    2.0      8.65        
    3.0      9.50
    4.0      9.82
    6.0      9.98
    8.0      9.997
   10.0      9.9996
   12.0      9.99994  
   14.0      9.99999
</PRE> 

These numbers should be interpreted as the rating model's guess for what the
average margin of victory would be, if the same two teams met many times.

<P> 
A player's rating increases after any game in which he does better than the
expected margin.  So for example, if <EM>a+b-c-d</EM>=0.5, then the first
two players' ratings increase if they win by four points or more (and
decrease if they win by three points or less or, worse yet, lose).  That's
the first-order effect, but in general every game affects all players'
ratings; ratings are interdependent.  For example, suppose players J and K
always play together, and lose all their games.  They will both get
assigned a low rating.  Then suppose J gives up foosball for pinball, while
K goes off to play with other partners rated about the same as he, and
starts winning.  Then the model will infer that K is better than J: K's
rating will increase, and J's will decrease (not that he'll care...)

<P> 
Ratings take account of a player's performance in games, of course.
But the ratings also consider the strength of the player's partners and
opponents.  Hence, having a high winning percentage, or even a high average
margin of victory, does not by itself ensure a high rating.

<H2> Average margins of victory </H2>

Average margin of victory means, the difference between a player's score
and his opponents', summed over all his matches and divided by the number
of matches.  The last three columns show, for each player, his own average
margin of victory, that of his partners (over all their games, not just the
ones they played against him), and that of his opponents.  Achieving a high
average margin of victory, difficult enough in itself, is all the more
remarkable if accomplished against unusually strong competition (or,
conversely, teamed up with relatively weak partners).  Note, however, that
a strong player's opponents inevitably have a low and (probably negative)
average margin of victory simply because they have played against the
strong player and presumably mostly lost to him.

<H2> Technical Details </H2>

Player ratings are the parameters of a probabilistic model of game
outcomes, estimated by the method of maximum likelihood.  The model amounts
to a function that gives a probability for the entire set of game outcomes.
This function has two sets of arguments -- the game results, and a set of
parameters.  There is one parameter corresponding to each player.  The
player ratings reported above are the parameter values that maximize the
probability; informally, these are the parameter values that make the
observed game outcomes as likely as possible under the model chosen.

<P> 
Suppose players with ratings of <EM>a,b,c</EM> and <EM>d,</EM>
respectively, play a game (<EM>a</EM> and <EM>b</EM> versus <EM>c</EM> and
<EM>d</EM>).  I'm modeling the probability that <EM>a</EM> and <EM>b</EM>
win a point off <EM>c</EM> and <EM>d</EM> as a function
<EM>p(a,b,c,d)</EM>, defined as

<PRE>
      <EM>p(a,b,c,d) = exp(a+b-c-d)/( 1 + exp(a+b-c-d) ).</EM>
</PRE>

Notice <EM>p</EM> is monotonically increasing in <EM>a+b-c-d</EM>, and
ranges from 0 to 1.

<P>
The data we collect are of the form "a and b beat c and d by a score of 10
to m".  The losing score m therefore follows the negative binomial
distribution; the probability of that 10-to-m score is a function
<EM>L(m,a,b,c,d),</EM> defined as

<PRE>
     <EM>L(m,a,b,c,d) = ([9+m]!/[m!9!]) p^10 (1-p)^m</EM>
</PRE>

Notice that we can handle incomplete games just fine, as long as such
games end as the result of an event unrelated to the score; we replace 10
in the above formula with the actual winning score (and replace 9 with the
winning score minus 1). 

<P> 
The likelihood of the entire data set (all our games) is the product of the
L functions of all the games, with m set in each game to the losing score,
and <EM>a,b,c,d</EM> set to the relevant players' parameters.  The player
ratings reported at the top of this web page result from maximizing this
likelihood function over parameters corresponding to the players.

<P>
There are a few caveats to bear in mind, relating to the realism of this
model.  The negative binomial distribution is appropriate if the outcomes
of individual points are independent events.  In reality, they are not, if
only because we score one point for sinking two balls, and two points for
sinking three.  Another caveat is that we don't record which players
started on offense and which on defense.  To the extent that initial
positions matter to game outcomes, the symmetry implicit in the
<EM>a+b-c-d</EM> kernel introduces a wedge between model and reality.  A
third caveat is that a person's playing strength is assumed constant: this
undermines the model's ability to predict the next game's outcome.  No
probabilistic model, however, can be both fully realistic and tractable;
the proof is in the pudding, i.e. validation tests, and the ones I've done
show this model to be reasonably successful at predicting game outcomes.

<H2> Linear Foosball </H2>

Linear Foosball is an alternative scoring system.  Instead of counting one
point for two balls and two for all three balls (we'll call that Standard
Persistence Foosball, or SPF), in Linear Foosball we simply count one point
for each ball.  The game ends when there are no more balls on the table and
at least one team has scored at least ten points.  (Possible game scores
include 11-10 and 12-9 as well as other combinations that add up to a
multiple of 3.  Playing until all the balls are gone ensures that there is
never a need to judge "who got to 10 points first", in the case of
nearly-simultaneous goals.  Ties are impossible since neither 10-10 nor
11-11 add up to a multiple of 3.)


<P> Linear Foosball games are shorter; each inning produces three points,
instead of one or, rarely, two in SPF.  But Linear Foosball poses a problem
for the rating system; the implication, for players' ratings, of a given
score is one thing if that score came from a Linear Foosball game, and
another thing if the score came from a SPF game.  For example, in SPF a
team can lose 10-0 and still have sunk quite a few balls (as many as 10).
In Linear Foosball, shutouts are much harder to accomplish, as indeed all
scores tend to be closer.  Clearly, LF scores need adjustment if we are to
throw them in with SPF scores in the game database.

<P>
The most straightforward way to adjust LF scores is to keep track of which
team scored each ball, and record a parallel, SPF-style, score.  But this
would impose an unreasonable demand on the players, who are understandably
preoccupied with just playing the game.  Therefore we do the next-best
thing: we convert LF scores to their SPF equivalents in expected value (in
the probabilistic meaning of that term).  Here is how to compute that
expected value.

<PRE>
Let
   w = the winning score (LF-style)
   l = the losing score (LF-style)
   
Define
   p = w/(w+l)        
   n = (w+l)/3
</PRE>

Thus <EM>p</EM> is the probability that the winning team will sink a given
ball, and <EM>n</EM> is the number of three-ball innings played.  We can
calculate the expected result of a SPF match that lasts <EM>n</EM> innings,
and played between teams whose relative strengths are measured by
<EM>p</EM>.  We will call this the "equivalent SPF match".

<P> Each inning of the equivalent SPF match can result in one of four
outcomes -- the winning team scores two points (outcome e), the winning
team scores one point (outcome f), the losing team scores two points
(outcome g), and the losing team scores one point (outcome h).

<P> These four outcomes have probabilities as follows:
<PRE>
   Prob(e) = p^3
   Prob(f) = 3(1-p)p^2
   Prob(g) = (1-p)^3
   Prob(h) = 3p(1-p)^2
</PRE>

<P>
The expected value of the winning teams score in the equivalent SPF match
is therefore
<PRE>
   n*( Prob(e) + Prob(f) )
</PRE>
while the losing team's expected score in the equivalent SPF match is
<PRE>
   n*( Prob(g) + Prob(h) )
</PRE>

<P> It is these equivalent SPF scores that the rating system considers,
when it combines scores from Linear Foosball with scores from SPF.  As a
matter of fact, the total number of possible final scores in Linear
Foosball is small enough to make it practical to list them all, below, next
to their SPF equivalents.

<PRE>
        -LF-    ---SPF----
        12-9    5.55-3.31
        12-6    6.22-1.78
        12-3    7.04-0.56
        12-0    8.00-0.00
        11-10   4.76-4.01
        11-7    5.35-2.37
        11-4    6.09-0.97
        11-1    7.00-0.08
        10-8    4.53-3.03
        10-5    5.19-1.48
        10-2    6.02-0.31
</PRE> 

<P> Regarding the formula above for <EM>L(m,a,b,c,d)</EM>: when the scores
are not whole numbers, the factorials are replaced with the gamma function.

<P> Linear Foosball matches in the game database are easily
identifiable; the scores are lower, and they are usually not whole
numbers.
