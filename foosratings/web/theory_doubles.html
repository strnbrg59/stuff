<H2> Ratings and their interpretation </H2>

As you can see, everyone gets two ratings -- one for offense, one for
defense.  Your rating depends on how well you do, but also on how good
your partner and your opponents are.  So if two good (highly-rated)
players go up against two beginners, the aces don't just need to win,
they need to win by a wide margin, or else their ratings will drop
(and the duffers' ratings will increase).  I hope that this knowledge
will eliminate any reluctance you might have to play with a partner
who is a beginner; yes you may lose, but your rating can go up even if
you lose!

<P> Those required/expected winning margins can be read off from the
following table: 

<PRE>
 spread  victory_margin
   0.0       0.00
   0.1       0.34
   0.2       0.68
   0.3       1.01
   0.4       1.34
   0.5       1.65
   0.6       1.95
   0.7       2.24
   0.8       2.51
   0.9       2.76
   1.0       2.99
   1.1       3.20
   1.2       3.39
   1.3       3.55
   1.4       3.70
   1.5       3.84
   1.6       3.96
   1.7       4.06
   1.8       4.16
   1.9       4.24
   2.0       4.32
</PRE>    

<P> Suppose a team rated <EM>a</EM> and <EM>b</EM> takes
on a team rated <EM>c</EM> and <EM>d</EM>.  Now find abs(a+b-c-d) and
look it up in the first column (the "spread").  The number in the
second column now represents the expected margin of victory for the
stronger team.  (I know you can't have fractional outcomes in
Foosball.  What 1.34 means is that if those two teams played 100
times, then the average margin of victory would be about 1.34.)

<P>
Of perhaps more immediate relevance is that if your team is rated,
say, 0.4 more than your opponents, then your rating will drop if
you don't win by two or more points!

These ratings are the parameters of a probabilistic model of game
outcomes, estimated by the method of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood">maximum
likelihood.</a> The model amounts to a function that gives a
probability for the entire set of game outcomes.  This function has
two sets of arguments -- the game results, and a set of parameters.
The player ratings are the parameter values that maximize the
probability; informally, these are the parameter values that make the
observed game outcomes as likely as possible under the model chosen.

</P>

<P> Suppose a team made up of players rated <EM>a</EM> and <EM>b</EM>
and a team whose players are rated <EM>c</EM> and <EM>d</EM>
play a game.  I'm modeling the probability that the first team wins
a point off the second team as a function

<PRE>
      <EM>p(a,b,c,d) = exp(a+b-c-d)/( 1 + exp(a+b-c-d) ).</EM>
</PRE>

Notice <EM>p</EM> is monotonically increasing in <EM>a+b-c-d</EM>, and
ranges from 0 to 1.

<P>
Foosball games, as we know, end when one team reaches 5.
The losing score -- let's call it <EM>m</EM> -- therefore follows the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_binomial_distribution">negative
binomial distribution</a>.  In other words, the probability of a 5-to-m
outcome is a function

<PRE>
     <EM>L(m,p(a,b,c,d)) = ([5-1+m]!/[m!(5-1)!]) p(a,b,c,d)^5 (1-p(a,b,c,d))^m</EM>
</PRE>

<P> 
The likelihood of the entire data set (all our games) is the product
(I'm assuming successive games, as well as successive points, are
independent events) of the L functions of all the games, with m
set in each game to the losing score, and <EM>a,b,c,d</EM>
set to the relevant players' parameters.
<P>
