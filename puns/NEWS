0.3.0
  Network server, no client (gotta use telnet)

0.3.1
  "make dist" produces something that builds

0.4.0
  Client starts server if there's no server up.  Waits until server is
  ready and then sends the clue word.

1.0.0
  "Except" filtering (sorta like egrep -v).
  Web page with title, explanations -- somewhat presentable.

1.1.0
  Tolerance -- affecting just cmdline.word_cutoff.

1.2.0
  Cleaned up shaks12.txt and added words to cmudict.  Lots of work and in the
  end it only reduced the number of lines I have to reject from 27584 to 24300
  (out of 82233 lines in total).

1.3.0
  Matching part of punchline is indicated in dark green.
