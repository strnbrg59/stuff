This program takes what you type next to "word:" and tries to find
something that sounds like it, among all of Shakespeare's plays and
sonnets and anything else Shakespearean covered by the Guttenberg project
(http://www.gutenberg.org).

<P> Perfect matches -- lines of Shakespeare that actually contain your
word -- are not reported; it's not a pun if the match is perfect.  You
can, optionally, define other matches as insufficiently funny by
entering them next to "except".  For example, if your word is
<TT>horse,</TT> then you probably want to exclude <TT>hoarse.</TT> To
exclude more than one match, separate them with the | character,
e.g. <TT>hoarse|whore</TT>.

<P> The number to the left of every line of your results is called the
"badness".  At badness 0, the line will contain something (indicated
by contrasting color) that sounds just like your word.  At higher
badness ratings, the match becomes less and less exact -- m's
substituted for n's, g's for k's, entire syllables skipped, etc.  An
average user has trouble recognizing his word above badness 3 or so,
while a Shakespeare expert might top out around 7.
Mathematically, badness is defined as the inverse of tolerance.
Physically, badness indicates the resistance of the human brain to
humor, and is therefore measured in ohms per volt meter
squared.  Set "maximum badness" to a higher number if you don't get
enough (or any) hits at the default.

<P> The "multiword match only" checkbox is another filter.  When it's
checked, the only lines shown are those in which your word matches
across two or more words.  I think those are funnier, but you decide.

<P> Only your imagination limits what you can do with the results.
Work them into after-dinner speeches, sprinkle them like gravitas
crystals over your college papers, deliver them as the knockout punch
in a political argument.  My favorite application of course is
inventing sophisticated knock-knock jokes.  Here's one for mathematicians:

<PRE>
    Knock knock!
    Who's there?
    Riemann.
    Riemann who?
    <EM>But I and Har<FONT COLOR=#007700>ry Mon</FONT>mouth!</EM> (Henry IV, Act V, Scene 2)

Here's a pickup line for all you single guys out there:

    Rhino.
    Rhino who?
    <EM>Thou hast no husband yet, no<FONT COLOR=#007700>r I no</FONT> wife!</EM> (The Comedy of Errors, Act III, Scene 2)

<P>
And here's one that'll resonate with any disappointed dot-com investor:
<PRE>
    Knock, knock.
    Who's there?
    Stock.
    Stock who?
    <EM>With mine own weakness being be<FONT COLOR=#007700>st acq</FONT>uainted.</EM> (Sonnet 88)

<P>
Can't think of anything that rhymes with Orange?
<PRE>
    Knock, knock.
    Who's there?
    Orange.
    Orange who?
    <EM>And when I mount, alive may I not light,

    [or]
    <EM>His eyes do drop no tears his prayers <FONT COLOR=#007700>are in j</FONT>est.</EM>(Richard II, Act V, Scene 3)

<P>
A new motto for ex-Congressman Anthony Weiner of the lewd emails?
<PRE>

    We are arrant knaves all.</EM> (Hamlet Act 3, Scene 1)

<BR> Or experience the bard through Beavis & Butthead's ears:
<PRE>
    <EM>Is the young Dauphin every <FONT COLOR=#007700>way c</FONT>omplete...</EM>
    "He said, 'whack'."

    <EM>April when they <FONT COLOR=#007700>woo, D</FONT>ecember when they wed...</EM>
