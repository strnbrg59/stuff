The two "alignable_yes" photos are smallish pictures that should get aligned
quickly.

The two "alignable_no" photos are of different parts of the sky;
they're for testing what happens when the program can't align things.

The "deneb" photos are both more numerous and, for some of them, hard to align.
But alignable they are.  They are for the "long" test.
