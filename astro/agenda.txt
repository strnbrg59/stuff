8/6/04. Bug -- attempt to reference out of bounds pixel.  Set threshold=0 in
        unittest.sh and see how it fails on the deneb test.

8/6/04. Confirmation (don't allow a star into the sum unless it appears on
        at least two ppms).

8/6/04. Checkpoint files, and ability to start alignment from a checkpoint
        file.

8/6/04. Deconvolution: gather up eliptical stars into circles.  (Even with
        3 megapixels and 8 second exposures, at the celestial equator a star
        will move almost a pixel.)

8/6/04. Image subtraction.

12/30/06. Remove gross cases of hot pixels by comparing *unaligned* pictures!

1/8/09. Report statistics, for each picture, of stars visible in that picture
        but not in the others.

1/8/09. Color.
