1. Turtle that looks different on top than on bottom, so we can better
determine its orientation.  (If its top looks like its bottom, it's
impossible to guess which way is "right" without tracing through the
path to its current position).

2. Pen-up and pen-down.
Done

3. Fog
Done.

4. Change pencolor for just one segment.
Done

5. Tubes instead of line segments.

6. Logo driver (see ucblogo-patches subdirectory).

7. Turtle that walks on a sphere.
Done

8. Use stored whatchamacallits instead of retracing the whole route
each call to Drawing::Redraw().
