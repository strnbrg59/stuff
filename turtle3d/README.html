Turtle3d is a 3-dimensional turtle graphics package with your choice
of Logo, Python or Tcl interface.  Download it <A
HREF="http://trhj.homeunix.net/~strnbrg/turtle3d.tar.gz">here.</A>

<A><IMG SRC="images/turtle_spiral.gif" ALIGN="right" HSPACE=20></A>

<P> To build, check that the X11_HOME and OPENGL_HOME variables at the
top of Makefile are correct for your system, and then type "gmake".
It's been tested on Linux and FreeBSD.

<P>
To start the Python version, type this at the shell prompt:
<PRE>
% python -i turtle.py
</PRE>

<P>
A window should pop up now, with a pointy triangle (the "turtle") in
the middle of that window.

<P>
And then a sample session might look like this:
<PRE>
>>> fd(50)
>>> rt(90)
>>> fd(45)
>>> up(120)
>>> rl(45)
>>> fd(60)
</PRE>

<P>
The names of the commands are inspired by Logo's -- fd=forward,
bk=backward, rt=right, lt=left, pu=pen-up, pd=pen-down.  In addition,
you can pitch the turtle up (up) or down (dn), and roll it (rl --
there's no "left roll", just roll by a negative number of degrees).

<P> Use your mouse to rotate (left button + drag), pan (middle button)
and zoom (right button) the image.

<H3> Walking on a sphere </H3>

The turtle can be constrained to the surface of a sphere.  To do that,
use <TT>sfd</TT> instead of <TT>fd</TT> and <TT>sbk</TT> instead of
<TT>bk</TT> (and don't use <TT>rl</TT>, <TT>up</TT> or <TT>dn</TT> at
all!)  The units of <TT>sfd</TT> and <TT>sbk</TT> are degrees.

<A><IMG SRC="images/sphere.gif" ALIGN="right" HSPACE=20></A>

<P> There is no "sphere mode"; you can type <TT>sfd</TT> and then
<TT>fd</TT> anywhere and anytime you want.  However, <TT>sfd</TT>
always assumes the turtle is currently on the surface of a sphere.
So, in a sequence of commands such as

<PRE>
>>> sfd(90)
>>> fd(100)
>>> sfd(90)
</PRE>

the first and second <TT>sfd</TT>'s will each trace one quarter of a
great circle, but they will not lie on the same sphere.

<P> If you want to see a shaded blue sphere like the one at right,
give the following commands:

<PRE>
>>> sphere(1)
>>> lighting(1)
</PRE>

<H2> Other interfaces </H2>

<H3> Tcl </H3>

To start the Tcl version, start tclsh and then your first command to
the Tcl interpreter should be "source turtle.tcl".  At this point, the
commands look just like the Python commands except instead of
parentheses use spaces, i.e. "fd 50", "rt 90", etc.

<H3> minimalistic </H3>

<P> The executable you have built -- <TT>draw</TT> -- reads Logo-style
turtle commands from standard input.  Thus the following could be
considered the minimal interface:

<PRE>
% cat | ./draw
fd 50
lt 120
pu
</PRE>

<P> And less minimal but still quite spare:

<PRE>
% sh | ./draw
for i in 1 2 3 4 5
do
echo fd 50
echo rt 75
done
</PRE>

<H3> Logo </H3>

I've saved this part for last because getting to a Logo interface
takes some doing.

<UL>

<LI> Grab the source code to <A
HREF="http://trhj.homeunix.net/~strnbrg/ucblogo-5.1.tar.gz"> ucblogo
5.1</A> and unpack it.  (I'm storing it here because the most <A
HREF="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bh/logo.html">recent version</A> is
now up to 5.3 and I'm not inclined to try tracking that.)

<LI> Apply the patchfile -- that's the file readline-popen-patchfile you
find in turtle3d.tar.gz.  (Copy the patchfile to the ucblogo directory and
type "patch < readline-popen-patchfile".)  The patchfile does two things, one
just a convenience, the other essential:

  <UL>

  <LI> It puts GNU readline support into ucblogo.  That's the
convenience.  If you don't want readline, or you don't have the
readline library and header files on your development system, or you
do but there's some problem, you can delete from
readline-popen-patchfile the sections that refer to the file "parse.c"
and the file "configure".

  <LI> It introduces a popen function into ucblogo.  This is the essential
       part.
  </UL>

<LI> Build the patched ucblogo with the standard "./configure; make;
make install" sequence.  (Note it won't start if you don't say "make
install"; not sure why this is...)

<LI> With "turtle3d" as your current working directory and "logo" on your PATH,
start up like this:
<PRE>
logo turtle3d.lg
</PRE>

This should bring up the OpenGL window -- not Logo's graphics window
but the window that's produced by the "draw" executable.  You're now
off and running.  You have the standard Logo turtle commands <TT> fd,
bk, rt, lt, pu, pd, ht, st </TT> as well as the 3-D ones <TT> up, dn,
rl </TT> and the spheroidal <TT> sfd and sbk. </TT> To bring up the
blue sphere type <TT> lighting 1 sphere 1. </TT>

</UL>

<H3> Further features of the Python interface </H3>

You can write a file of Python functions that use the turtle commands.
The file examples.py shows how this might be done.  To use the
functions from examples.py, it's necessary to start up a little
differently.  Your shell command should no longer be "python -i
turtle.py" but rather

<PRE>
% python
</PRE>

and then, at the Python interpreter prompt, type

<PRE>
>>> from turtle import *
>>> turtleInit()
>>> import examples
</PRE>

then execute one of the functions from examples.py as follows:

<PRE>
>>> examples.randwalk3d()
</PRE>

And we can go even more automated than that.  Have a look at the file
callexamples.py, and then, at the shell prompt, type

<PRE>
% python callexamples.py
</PRE>
